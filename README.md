# Alien-Invasion

A working version of Space Invaders that was built using PyGame as guided by Eric Matthews' book Python Crash Course. This is a recreation of the arcade game Space Invaders in where the user has to destroy all the aliens that are sliding across and down the screen to reach the next level. As the levels get higher, the speed of the aliens and the ship's bullet increase as well. Game over is achieved when an alien either touches the ship or the bottom of the screen.

# Steps-to-use

To use:

  • PyGame must be installed

  • Download all the files
  
  • To play the game, run the alien_invasion.py file using Python 3
  
# Controls
  
  • Click the 'Play' button to start the game
  
  • Control the ship using the arrow keys
  
  • Quit the game by pressing 'Q' at any time
